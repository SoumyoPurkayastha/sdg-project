This is a simple fitness tracking app.
It has two fuctionalities:
   1. Adding a workout report for a day
   2. Showing the total calories burnt in a week

The first one is about doing the basic react things like handling forms, managing state, mapping to components, etc.
The second functionality is about passing data from one component to another through a parent component.

Due to time binds, I could not finish the second functionality, so it only updates one cycle after every input. If you add 5 workouts, it will only show the total for the first four.
